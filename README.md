Some facts of the C++ world, sometimes useful, sometimes not (mostly, impractical).

But, that doesn't make these fact less important, right?

## Assumptions

1. I hope, all the code is compilable (more or less).

2. Code is written in C++17.

3. If you don't love C++, you won't like these pieces of code.

## Contents

### 1. Move me please

### 2. Really constexpr

### 3. Prime
